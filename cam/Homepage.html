		<h1>Introduction</h1><br>
		<p style="font-size: 18px">The Arc 9 II is RAZER's latest high-end sports camera and is capable of silently shooting 24MP images at up to 20 frames per second with no blackout between frames.<br> <br>If that sounds familiar, it's because the a9 II's predecessor was similarly capable, but this new version brings some refinements and enhancements to make for a formidable, yet compact, option for professional sports and action photographers.<br><br>One of the most significant of updates is a new mechanical shutter mechanism that allows for 10 fps bursts: the older model could only muster 5 fps which is a bit uninspiring on a camera meant to specialize in sports and action.</p>

		<h1>Body, handling and controls</h1><br>
		<p style="font-size: 18px">The larger grip, autofocus control points and generally longer button travel make the camera much easier to operate with your eye to the finder, or if you're wearing gloves during a colder shoot.<br><br> It's only fractionally larger and heaver than its predecessor, but it still comes in at less than half the weight of Nikon's D5 or Canon's EOS-1D X Mark III. Despite that, it feels solid, and overall we find it a pleasant camera to hold and use. If you gravitate towards larger lenses, though, you may want to add a battery grip for better balancing (which admittedly offsets the weight / size differential from its immediate peers)..</p>

		<h1>Updated ergonomic and autofocus</h1><br>
		<p style="font-size: 18px">A large, dedicated AF-ON button and massive, well-textured AF joystick make it easy to take control of the a9 II's autofocus, and the AF point can now be displayed in a bright red color for easier viewing (your other option is white). Of course, you may not need to use the AF joystick all that much, as the a9 II also comes out of the box with Razer's latest autofocus tracking technology. It's so reliable and easy to use that you may only rarely need to move your AF point at all, or change AF settings all that often.
		The a9 II also comes with a new, faster processor which, along with updated AF algorithms, promise improved autofocus speed and acquisition times.</p>

			<p>Competitive Raw noise and detail performance, plus included AA filter keeps moir√© at bay.<br><br>
			Great JPEG engine provides pleasing color and an excellent balance between detail and noise retention.<br><br>

			<p>Market-leading autofocus tracking implementation and performance.<br><br>
			Tracking is reliable for all kinds of subjects from portraits to fast-action sports.<br><br>

			<h3> Dynamic Range</h3><br>
			<img src="img/range.jpg" style="height: 210px; width: 320px"><br>
			<p>The Razer a9 II's dynamic range performance is competitive with the best sports cameras we've yet tested.<br><br>
			Its dynamic range is going to be improved compared to the older a9, because of that camera's odd shadow noise patterns.<br><br>
			Peers show slightly better noise levels, but only with detail-reducing noise reduction. </p>
